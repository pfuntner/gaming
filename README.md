This repo contains some scripts I've come up with to work with a couple of gaming sites I like to use:

| Folder     | Site                                        | Comments                                                                                                               |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [iyt](iyt) | [ItsYourTurn.com](http://ItsYourTurn.com)   | completely turn-based games.  I like to play variations of Othello/Reversi, Battleship, Yahtzee, Backgammon            |
| [bga](bga) | [BoardGameArena](http://boardgamearena.com) | Real-time and turn-based games.  I play Cribbage, Yahtzee (_but I prefer the IYT variations_), Martian Dice, Just One) |
