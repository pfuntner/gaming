Repository for scripts related to ItsYourTurn (aka IYT)

[IsYourTurn.com](https://itsyourturn.com) is a site where people can play a variety of strategy games in a turn-based manner:
  - Games are usually not completed in a single day - many, especially certain types of games, only last a few days but I've personally played games that lasted months and even more than a year
  - Two players play each game but the players do not have to be online at the same time.  Each player takes one turn at a time when they are able.  Games can time out if a player does not play their turn within a time limit

I am just a software developer who plays games at IYT.  I don't work for them and I don't develop code for their site.

## Scripts

| Script | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [`history`](history.md) | Collects your overall game history and renders to a file format |
| [`history2mysql`](history2mysql.md) | Uploads overall game history (produced by `history` script) to MySQL database |

## Discussion

I created a message board at [`itsyourturn.freeforums.net`](http://itsyourturn.freeforums.net) for IYT users and we can talk about the tools there.
